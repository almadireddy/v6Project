# v6 File System Explorer

This program is a class assignment for CS 4348: Operating Systems Concepts. It takes as input a binary file representing a modified v6 file system that has 1024 bytes per block, and a filename. It will look in the file system for the given filename and attempt to read that file, then write it out to `myoutputfile.txt`.

## Running the program

I assume that you will have the modified v6 filesystem at a known directory. Run `make` to compile or `make run` to make, and then run the output binary.
